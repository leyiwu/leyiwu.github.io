# Hey, this is William👋!

I'm a first year Computer Science Student at the University of Toronto. I'm interested in Artificial Intellegence, Cloud Computing, and software development. 

# Personal Life 📖

 I was born in Shandong, China. A half pinisula with beautiful oceans and mountains as well as many kind hearted people. 

This is the birthplace of Confucious and many of acient Chinese culture. Surrounded by this environment, I'm quite interested in [春秋](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_and_Autumn_Annals),  [孟子](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mencius/), [荀子](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/xunzi/), and many other classics. 

Now I'm on my journey to purse an undergraduate degree in Computer Science at the University of Toronto!

## Interests 👨‍💻

~~Computer science~~
 
Yes and outside of that, I'm into music, basketball, paddling and gaming. 

I'm planning to build a PC during the summer of 2023, looking forward to that a lot!

You'll usually see me in the gym, and hopefully touching some grass ocassasionally 💀
